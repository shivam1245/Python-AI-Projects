# Python-AI-Projects
Projects related to artificial intelligence based on python

## Setup
## Install all required libraries
- Configure the python sdk in project settings.
- Set python3 path, for python 3 below is steps.

- Virtual environments setup -

    For Mac/Linux ->
    - Create virtual environment -> 
        - `python -m venv venv`,

    - Activate environment -> 
        - `source venv/bin/activate`

    For windows -> 
    - Create virtual environment
        - python -m venv name of folder(eg. venv)
        - `python -m venv venv`
    - Activate environment
        - `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`

- Install -> `pip install -r requirements.txt`




## 1. Generate Poetic text with Recurrent Neural Network.

- This Project is about Generating Poetic text from any random text file
- Here I'm using Google API for the file
- I used LSTM model and Recurrent Neural Network, for model creating.
